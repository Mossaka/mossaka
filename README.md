## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jiaxiao (Joe) Zhou, and I also go by Mossaka. I love building things that make developers' lives easier ðŸ’™.

I'm currently working at Microsoft's [DeisLabs](https://deislabs.io/) as a Software Engineer. Here are three tags that say a lot about my career

- Open Source
- WebAssembly
- Rust

I'm a maintainer of Containerd's [Runwasi](https://github.com/containerd/runwasi) project and [SpinKube](https://www.spinkube.dev/), both of which advance the state of the art for WebAssembly (Wasm) running on Kubernetes. I am also a Recognized Contributor to the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/), contributing to projects like [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen), [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools), and [go-modules](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/go-modules). I co-organize the Bytecode Alliance SIG Guest Languages Go Subgroup, where we discuss integrating Go with WebAssembly.

Outside of work, I am probably best known for running online [meetups](https://github.com/splvm) that focus on distributed systems, databases, operating systems, and emerging cloud-native technologies.

Below are a few activities that you may find interesting:

## Speaking

I enjoy sharing knowledge with other developers in the form of public speaking. I've spoken at a number of conferences and meetups, including:
